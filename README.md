# Trump-Tweets-Text-Analysis
Text analysis of Trump tweets between 2009 and 2017

In this project, we analysed 30,385 tweets of Donald Trump that were posted between 5.4.2009 and 27.1.2017. 

We analysed his general patterns of tweeting (i.e. prime time of his tweets, most tweets in one day, or how time of the tweet reflects its polarity), we looked into the sentiment and subjectivity of his tweets, for the most frequent used words, and also how was the landscape of his tweets different in different periods of his political life (before announcement of his presidential run, during the campaign, and after he got elected).

As this project was mainly about the text analysis, the main libraries used were NLTK, WordCloud, and TextBlob. Other libraries used: Re, Io, CV2, String, Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Altair, Seaborn, and Datetime.
